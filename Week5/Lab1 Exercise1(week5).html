</h1>

The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone.
If the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group
milworm didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka jdavis_a,
a resident of <A HREF="www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483 </A> homestead community on the Internet,
might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign
Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the Net for more such accounts!
Surprised? Or scared?

Whatever it is, jdevis_4 claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords
that he has got exactly 108 working passwords (and growing daily),
